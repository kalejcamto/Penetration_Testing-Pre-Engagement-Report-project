# Penetration_Testing-Pre-Engagement-Report-project

A Maui-based real estate firm, **Alexander Rocco Corporation**, has hired my consulting company to perform a covert penetration test on its network, which supports a luxury property (hotel, golf courses, restaurants). The Vice President, **Claudia Mae**, is my sole contact, and I will not be introduced to any other employees or IT staff. The objective is to **discover network infrastructure, topology, and vulnerabilities without internal assistance**, maintaining a completely black-box approach.

1. Project Scope and Objective
Alexander Rocco Corporation has contracted Consulting Company to perform a covert, black-box penetration test on its network infrastructure supporting its Maui, Hawaii properties (five-star hotel, golf courses, tennis courts, and restaurants).

The primary objective is to replicate an external threat actor to discover:

Network infrastructure and topology.

Digital vulnerabilities.

Crucial Stipulation: The testing will be conducted without any assistance from internal IT staff or company personnel. This mandates strict adherence to the Rules of Engagement (ROE) established below.

## Pre-Engagement Steps and Legal Review

Before starting any penetration test for Alexander Rocco Corporation in Maui, Hawaii, the following critical steps and legal considerations must be addressed. The limited contact (Claudia Mae is the sole liaison) makes these initial, formal steps even more crucial.

### 1. **Establish Formal Authorization (Contract and Rules of Engagement)** 
The priority is to formalize the scope to mitigate legal risk, especially since you will operate covertly:
* **Get Written Consent:** Obtain a **formal, signed contract** explicitly authorizing your company to conduct the penetration test. This document must be signed by Claudia Mae, confirming her authority to approve the testing on behalf of the Alexander Rocco Corporation.
* **Define Scope and Boundaries:** Clearly delineate the IP addresses, domains, systems, and applications included and **excluded** from the test. Given the black-box nature, the scope must be precise to avoid unauthorized access (a crime).
* **Specify Testing Timeframe:** Establish the exact dates and times when testing is authorized.
* **Liability and Indemnification:** The contract should clearly specify that the client **releases your company from liability** for any accidental service disruptions that occur during authorized testing.
* **Handling of Discovered Data:** Define protocols for the secure handling, storage, and deletion of any sensitive data (e.g., customer PII or corporate secrets) found during the test.

### 2. **Review Applicable Laws and Regulations** 

Because the company manages a luxury hotel and restaurants, their network will likely process sensitive customer data, subjecting the test to federal and state laws.

#### A. Federal Laws (Applicable to all U.S. States)
* **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (18 U.S.C. § 1030):** This is the most critical federal law. It criminalizes accessing a computer "without authorization" or exceeding authorized access. The signed Rules of Engagement (ROE) is your defense against a CFAA prosecution; any activity outside the ROE is illegal.
* **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA):** If the company processes certain financial information (which is common in resorts/hotels), the GLBA might apply, mandating protection of customer financial data.
* **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):** While technically a standard, not a law, compliance is mandatory for any entity (like a hotel or restaurant) that **stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data**. Your testing must be conducted in a way that checks for—and documents—PCI compliance gaps.

#### B. State of Hawaii Laws (Hawaii Revised Statutes - HRS)
* **HRS Chapter 708, Part IX (Offenses Against Property Rights - Computer Crimes):** This chapter outlines Hawaii's specific computer crime statutes, which may include unauthorized access, tampering, or service disruption penalties.
* **HRS Chapter 487N (Identity Theft and Protection):** As a state, Hawaii has specific requirements for protecting customer personal information (PII) and mandatory breach notification procedures. If the test successfully accesses customer records, these laws govern how that PII must be treated and reported.

### 3. **Information Gathering and Methodology Planning** 

Given the "black-box" scenario (no IT staff contact), the initial steps must focus on external reconnaissance:

* **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT):** Research the company's publicly available information (domains, IP ranges, employee names, social media data, job postings) to map the attack surface.
* **Determine Attack Surface:** Identify all external-facing assets, including websites, email servers, VPN portals, and cloud services associated with the Alexander Rocco Corporation.
* **Define Methodology:** Select the tools and techniques (e.g., automated scanning, manual verification, social engineering simulation) that will be used. Since the scope is covert, all activities must minimize the risk of a denial-of-service (DoS) event that could shut down the hotel or golf systems.
